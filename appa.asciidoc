== Attributes

All CF attributes are listed here except for those that are used to describe grid mappings. See Appendix F for the grid mapping attributes.

The "Type" values are **S** for string,
  **N** for numeric, and **D** for the type of the data variable. The "Use" values
  are **G** for global, **C** for variables containing coordinate data, and
  **D** for variables containing non-coordinate
  data. "Links" indicates the location of the attribute"s original definition
  (first link) and sections where the attribute is discussed in this document
  (additional links as necessary). .Attributes
