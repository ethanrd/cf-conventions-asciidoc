This is an *unofficial* work-in-progress to show how the CF metadata conventions
could be managed via GitHub, Travis-CI, and asciidoctor. The output from this
process can be seen at: http://cf-metadata.github.io/cf-conventions.html

For the official web site please visit: http://cfconventions.org/,
and the corresponding GitHub organisation: https://github.com/cf-convention.
